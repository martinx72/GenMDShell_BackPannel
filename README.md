# Note
DON'T use the Diagonal pliers to cut the acrylic!!!

The back panel of Genesis/MegaDrive from RGR is made of laser cutting acrylic. Using pliers do cut acrylic but the acrylic plate would be broken for sure. This is a very basic knowledge to work with acrylic. The best way to cut it is using a knife carefully. And, if you just use the finger force to press it out and not hold the rest of it using tools, acrylic would break also. Please be mindful when you want to cut any parts of the back panel we offered.
